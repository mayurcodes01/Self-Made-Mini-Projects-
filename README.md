# Self-Made-Mini-Projects-
This repository is a collection of my self-made mini projects, built while exploring and learning different concepts in programming, computer science, and problem-solving. Each project is small in scope but focuses on practicing real-world logic, hands-on coding, and improving my understanding of various technologies.
